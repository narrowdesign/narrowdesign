Well hey there, Rich.
<br><br>
Let me introduce myself. My name is Dan Christofferson, I run the marketing efforts at Big Cartel, and sell prints, paintings and stuff through my own store.
We've had a pretty amazing year this year, and a lot of it comes down to you and your store. That's right, YOUR store.
<br><br>
<b>You see, your store is the 250,000th Big Cartel store.</b>
<br><br>
Yup. You. We're sorta freaking out over here, and wanted to share it with you and include you on this journey if you'll have us. 
We've got some big plans to promote this milestone, including giving you a FREE STORE FOR LIFE! 
It's an unbelievably amazing feeling to see that 7 years into it, Big Cartel is still a good solution for working artists and we couldn't be happier that you picked the perfect time to sign up.
<br><br>
What do you need to do:
<br><br>
1. Say hi. We'll juice your plan up to a free store as soon as we hear back from you.
2. Hang some curtains. We've noticed you're still using the default theme/colors in your shop. 
Let us know if you'd like a hand in gussying up the joint, we plan on spreading the word about your store all over the place!
<br><br>

We'd love to do a little interview, find out a bit more about your life as an artist, and your background. We'll put together some more thoughts, but for now we just couldn't wait to spread the news. 
Please keep it hush for now, but know you're in for a real good time.
<br><br>

Love,
<br><br>
Anna, Eric, Lee, Matt, Dan (and the rest of the Big Cartel posse)</p></div>

			<h3>So we eventually get to June 2012 when Rich unsuspectingly opened a Big Cartel shop to sell his work, and it just happened to be our 250,000th store. It was a huge milestone for Big Cartel, so we flew Rich out to SLC, held him a one man art show, hired a band, roasted some s'mores, drank champagne, and invited a few hundred people.<br><br>No big deal. The video tells it better.</h3>
