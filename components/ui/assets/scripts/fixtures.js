    quotes: [
      'Meta-design is much more difficult than design; it’s easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it',
      'Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.',
      'An algorithm must be seen to be believed.',
      'Computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty.',
      'The designer of a new kind of system must participate fully in the implementation.',
      'We should continually be striving to transform every art into a science: in the process, we advance the art.'

    quotes: [
      'The cycle changes-conceive an idea, the computer generates form alternatives. We evaluate and select. The seams are more abbreviated. The realm of possibilities expands.',

      'If you can design one thing, you can design everything.',
      'If you do it right, it will last forever.',
      'You can reach timelessness if you look for the essence of things and not the appearance. The appearance is transitory — the appearance is fashion, the appearance is trendiness — but the essence is timeless.'

      'Interesting things happen when the creative impulse is cultivated with curiosity, freedom and intensity.',
      'You know, whenever I was presented with a challenge that brought up feelings of fear or self-doubt, I almost always said, “Yes”.',
      'Failure is built into creativity... the creative act involves this element of “newness” and “experimentalism,” then one must expect and accept the possibility of failure.',
      'I often think that presentations are more difficult than the work itself.',

    quotes: [
      'The grid system is an aid, not a guarantee. It permits a number of possible uses and each designer can look for a solution appropiate to his personal style. But one must learn how to use the grid; it is an art that requires practice.',
      'I would advise young people to look at everything they encounter in a critical light … Then I would urge them at all times to be self-critical.',

      'Is the grid a programme? …if the grid is considered as a proportional regulator, a system, it is a programme par excellence.',
      'Style is the adaptation of the forms of function and display to the spirit (and hence to the taste) of the times.',
      '[Is integral typography] a new label? The typographical aspect of a new ism? No, this is just what is not meant. The times of both, pioneers and isms , are over. After the adventurers of the 1910s and the 20s we are the settlers, the colonizers.',
      'In the ’20s for instance it was claimed for the first time that the typographer should proceed from the data of his material, from the basic typographic elements; today it is hardly conceivable that he should not proceed from them.',
      'Such ‘either or’ criteria have served their time and purpose. … ‘There remain only open doors to be unlocked’, as the German saying has it. … Nobody will relieve us of the task of searching for new criteria.',
      'Here the designer must intervene, he must in a sense aim at a larger whole; he must not continue to carry out the single task so much as create structures from which single solutions can be derived.',
      'The act of describing the task is part of the solution....the more precise and complete these criteria are, the more creative the work.'

    title: 'Muriel Cooper',
    quotes: [
      'I guess I’m never sure that print is truly linear. It’s more a simultaneous medium. Designers know a lot about how to control perception, how to present information in some way that helps you find what you need, or what it is they think you need. Information is only useful when it can be understood.',
      'Paul Rand was one of the first people I met with, he was very critical of my typography. I had a mission: design was a way of life',
      'What is this new medium? In general its outstanding characteristics are dynamic in real time, interactive, incredibly malleable, some capability of learning and adapting to the user, or to information, or to some other set of relationships. Our goal is to make information into some form of communication… Information by itself does not have the level of ‘filtering’ that design brings to it.',
      'I thought about books as being like a movie. Once I presented the Bauhaus book as a single-frame movie—showing all the pages in rapid succession. It was fantastic.',
      'When you start talking about design in relation to computers, you’re not just talking about how information appears on the screen, you’re talking about how it’s designed into the architecture of the machine and of the language. You have different capabilities, different constraints and variables than you have in any other medium, and nobody even knows what they are yet.'

      'You will learn most things by looking, but reading gives understanding. Reading will make you free.',
      'So that is the design process or the creative process. Start with a problem, forget the problem, the problem reveals itself or the solution reveals itself and then you reevaulate it. This is what you are doing all the time.',
      'Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions, there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that’s why it is so complicated.',
      'Simplicity is not the goal. It is the by-product of a good idea and modest expectations.',
