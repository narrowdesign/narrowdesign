    <h1>WPP team history</h1>
    <p>
      This isn’t the real history of WPP, it’s more like the bones of the story
      I’ve pieced together through conversations, observations, experience, and
      probably some shit I just made up.
    </p>
    <p>But reading the rambling that follows helps to orient me.</p>
    <p>
      I’ve always wanted to understand what I’m part of, both within the history
      of the team/org/company I’ve been at and within the broader
      design/tech/world history. There was a moment last night where I realized,
      “we are in the good old days.” I try to notice those and they’re sort of
      checkpoints I can jump back to when I want to remember my own story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greeks had a cool notion called Kairos (again, you’re going to get my
      poor understanding of it). Kairos is one of those moments in a society
      when the frames of reference shift. There’s a metamorphosis of the
      fundamental principles, beliefs, and symbols and the lines between science
      and magic, history and myth, blur. Real change is then possible. The
      unimaginable becomes possible and fundamental breakthroughs in science and
      art happen. If we decide to be, i think we are in one of these times.
    </p>
    <p>
      There have been several of these moments in the history of this team. Some
      of them we can see by looking back but others didn't happen because we
      were distracted, working hard on the wrong thing, or scared. Taking
      advantage of now requires being aware of the moment and context we’re in.
    </p>
    <p>
      One alternative is that we decide to be in a time when we’re making
      landing pages and complaining about things outside our control or how it
      used to be better. I’ve been through several of those cycles and now feels
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing else but the past to make new things out of. All of
      history (or as much of it as is known) is potential material for the work
      of any artist, storyteller, or craftsman. Noah Pepper, Brad, BDC, Bill,
      Sdot, Thomas, Adam Murray, Mr Haddad, Aytekin, Myles, Zach, Chris, Cam,
      Elsa, Yuin, Alex, Lindsay, Jonnie, Kim, Jamie… These people were on this
      team and now aren't. We'll all be on that list at some point. I hope that
      when we are gone, the person reading our names is among the most talented
      people in our field, just as you are. It's our job to make sure they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also think about all the people we almost hired but didn’t. Again, some
      of the best in our industry. You could have worked anywhere but you chose
      to work here. I think about the places we almost worked instead. Those
      places shape our story as much as the places we actually worked. If you
      were almost the third employee at OpenAI or turned down a meeting with the
      founder of Instagram when it was cool, that's a piece of who you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we reran our lives, the chances we’d ever have ended up here are slim.
      That we’d end up here together rounds to zero. Keeping that in mind makes
      it a lot easier to decide the things worth putting our finite collective
      energy into. It helps separate what’s temporary and not worth our time,
      and what could make this a place somebody we admire would want to work.
    </p>
    <p>A current photo of our team is an early photo. I love that idea.</p>
    <p>
      There could be hundreds, or thousands who come after us. I wish the 19-20
      people who passed through this team had thought more about their place in
      the continuum and known our story better and how their work affects all of
      us. I wish I could avoid caring too much about inconsequential things,
      keep in mind how fluid this all is.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have thought about this a lot since I did the first version of this WPP
      history, the day Jamie Kosoy started 5 years ago. I focused on the work we
      had done up to that point. I’m not going to do that now.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you draw an infinitely long timeline, it doesn't matter how far into it
      you get, you'll still be at the beginning. We are only about 20 years into
      the history of web design. We don't know shit. And it'll be many years
      before we should pretend to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web design at Stripe started with Ludwig. He was later the first designer
      at OpenAI.
    </p>
    Open AI now includes Brockman (their co-founder, our first CTO), Thomas
    Degry (our second Design Engineer), Maddie, and Karolis from Product Design
    <p>(and others)</p>
    Era includes Alex, Lindsay, Jonnie, and Adam Murray
    <p>Retool includes Krithix, Justin Pervorse, Cam, Zach</p>

    <p>Anthropic now includes Sam Macallister, Everett, Sasha (maybe Edwin)</p>

    <p>
      Some of these are names from the WPP list. Others were our partners from
      design or comms.
    </p>
    We are descended from Rdio, Adobe, Big Spaceship, Asana, Rally, Shopify,
    Google, The Atlantic and the dozens of other places we passed through to get
    <p>
      here. Right or wrong, these brands are a proxy for trust. We don’t have
      time to get to know everybody so we accept the credentials of the places
      they worked. In the world of web design, Stripe is now considered one of
      the best credentials. Maybe the best. We aspired to work here thanks to
      the people who worked here before us and the work they had done. At some
      point long ago a few people at Stripe decided to care about web design and
      we have stuck to that. We have always invested in web design more than was
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      There has always been a pull to systemize and automate and that isn't
      going to stop. It shouldn't. The push to protect creativity and novelty
      and to push the web design world forward has always been led by the
      individuals doing the work. It always should.
    </p>
    <p>
      Predictability and efficiency are comforting and systems are important.
      But since it's me writing, I’m going to admit that I think they should be
      avoided unless they occur naturally in the process of developing and using
      a visual/technical language to make the best things on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Language, the kind where you vibrate the air with your mouth in a way
      others can understand, wasn’t written down and then used. People were
      saying crazy shit before eventually, rules and documentation were
      developed, written down, and systematized. And even then it was left to
      the user to use it appropriately. I think the development of language is a
      great thing to copy and that the development of machines is not. Language
      is messy and fluid and anybody can change how it is used or copy what
      somebody else is doing but nobody gets to say "you can't do that with
      language" unless they want to get their glasses broken. Machines allow
      precision and scaling up of whatever we choose to make a lot of. It’s
      quite hard but if we choose to scale the things we are most proud of, it
      might lead to many things we are proud of. If we choose to scale things we
      are lukewarm about, we are guaranteed to create many things we are not
      proud of.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have managed to protect a certain amount of autonomy from outside
      forces and are learning to bootstrap our own creative opportunities.
      Different people (ICs and managers) have cared various amounts about those
      two things over our history. I picked them because I care about protecting
      them more than any other two I could think of while writing this all down.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if you and I and Rally hadn't joined Stripe? What if we’d all gone to
      Facebook or if Stripe had chosen another person to hire or design studio
      to buy? What if Stripe had prioritized finding somebody who cared more
      about deep technical systems or who only cared about visual design or
      design systems? We would be a very different team.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are the team we are because you value craft, relationships, efficiency,
      visual design, technical rigor… exactly as much as you do. So the history
      of WPP is just the history of the people who joined, combined with the
      thousands of web pages they designed and developed together, and the
      future they decided to make for themselves. That’s why we are in the
      present we find ourselves in where I am writing this and you are reading
      it and we are teammates.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m excited to write the next part of the story with you. For our pod
      that's the Moments story. What I care most about is that we focus on the
      things we’ll be glad we spent our brief window of time together focusing
      on. If it doesn’t make that time richer and better spent, if it doesn’t
      make us feel more alive and attract the people we wish worked here, let’s
      deprioritize it. It gives me great satisfaction to see that we are getting
      quite good at that!
    </p>
    <p>
      People who were part of the Bauhaus had no idea they were part of THE
      Bauhaus. They couldn't know that a hundred years later we’d still be
      copying their design style and trying to replicate their process of
      mechanizing quality. They needed history to unfold to see that back then
      they were part of something that would define design for the next hundred
      years. We need a hundred years to decide if any of this mattered, was too
      ambitious or too cautious, or if what we’re doing was worth being kept
      alive. I’m just happy I get to be part of the story and that you are now
      part of mine.
