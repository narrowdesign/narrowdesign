					<font size="+3"><b>Safety Philosophy</b></font><br />Recognizing that employee safety and health has a significant impact on one's overall quality of life, SBM Management Services is committed to providing a workplace in which recognized hazards are controlled. Occupational Health and Safety is one of our highest values and SBM believes that people are our most valuable asset. SBM takes our responsibility for providing a safe and healthy working environment and minimizing risks to employees, customers, contractors and others very seriously. Fulfilling this responsibility is fundamental to the success of our business. The philosophy and objectives behind this commitment are:<li>Safety is a core value embraced by every employee<br />The safety and health of all SBM employees is our first priority.<br />The only acceptable level of safety and health performance is one that prevents injury and accidents.<br />Safety and health, being an integral part of production and all other business functions, cannot be compromised.<br />Safety and health awareness are responsibilities that must be shared equally and without exception by everyone within the organization.<br />Management will be held accountable for the safety and health of personnel for whom they are responsible.<br />All employees will be required to make their safety, and the safety of their fellow workers, a first priority through reporting and communicating incidents through required methods.<br />As a condition of employment, each individual within the organization will be expected to conduct their duties in a manner that is consistent with the philosophy and objectives of this policy.</li><br /><b>SBM commits to uphold these principals and to make the continual <br />improvement of our employee health and safety (EHS) performance an integral part of our business.</b><br /><br /><font size="+3"><b>Safety Program</b></font><br />At SBM, safety is not only a core value; it's a business process that defines our success. We strive to provide a world-class safety program by focusing on manager-employee relationships, training, communication and raising safety standards and goals. As a result of this dedication, 85 percent of all SBM client sites have gone 12 months without a recordable accident.<br /><br />Fundamental to achieving this success is a comprehensive safety program that includes: <li>Daily tracking, validation and communication of safety metrics <br />Regular safety chats covering more than 100 safety training topics<br />Providing and enforcing the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)<br />Documented inspections of tools and equipment<br />Proactive response plans to pandemic outbreaks such as H1N1<br />Strict compliance with OSHA, state, local and customer EHS programs<br />Safety incentive programs</li><br /><br /><font size="+3"><b>Proven Performance</b></font><br /><b>Aerospace Customer</b><br /><b>1-year injury free</b><br />In celebration of the site’s one-year safety milestone, a catered lunch and gift raffle was held for the aerospace SBM employees. Everyone was given an individual certificate of achievement and a “One Year Injury Free” T-shirt. After the event, the below photograph and sign was proudly displayed next to the employee time clock as a reminder of the team’s safety record and motivation to reach the next milestone.<br /><br />“We are very pleased with this accomplishment and are now tasked with making the two year mark.

These metrics and goals are measured on a regular basis through site walks, formal audits and customer surveys. This data is uploaded into our performance management tool SBMinsite.com for customer visibility and is also delivered via scorecards and regular business reviews. This regular communication allows us to work with our clients to continually improve service delivery as well as develop solutions for short and long-term strategic goals. This transparency of information is also what helps us build long-term business partnerships, including a 20-year partnership with one Fortune 500 Company.<br /><br /><br /><font size="+3"><b>Proven Results</b></font><br />“Your team's efforts in Fort Wayne are top-notch.

				“Drive costs to world-class competitive levels while exceeding our customer expectations for quality and safety.”<br /><br />At SBM, we view the supply line as a critical element of our competitiveness. This requires our suppliers and the SBM team to work together to develop innovative solutions. Ideas from the supply line that foster this expectation must be brought forward as well as new and innovative solutions that benefit both parties.

			<name>SBM Supplier Code of Conduct</name>

			<bodyText>
				The SBM Supplier Code of Conduct (“Supplier Code”) sets forth principles that SBM has adopted to promote ethical conduct in the workplace, safe working conditions in SBM’s supply chain, treatment of workers with respect and dignity, and environmentally responsible processes. As used in this Supplier Code, “SBM” refers to SBM Management Services.<br /><br />SBM embraces diversity and legal compliance as fundamental principles and key components of its corporate strategy. It is our desire that all suppliers to SBM, their agents and their permitted subcontractors similarly embrace diversity and equal opportunity to the fullest extent possible. All suppliers must operate in full compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate, and they must act ethically at all times.<br /><br />In all aspects of the SBM/supplier working relationship, SBM’s suppliers and their agents and permitted subcontractors shall support SBM’s core values by conducting business with integrity, by treating others with respect, by striving for performance excellence and by accepting accountability for their conduct. SBM reserves the right to review or audit supplier compliance with this Code.<br /><br />The SBM Supplier Code of Conduct is not intended to create new or additional third party rights or obligations to third parties, including any rights of, or obligations to, employees of suppliers. It supplements, but does not supersede, any rights maintained by SBM under any contract with any supplier.<br /><br />The Supplier Code is comprised of five sections: general standards of conduct for SBM’s supply chain as outlined above, standards for Labor, Health and Safety, the Environment, and qualifying elements of an acceptable system to manage conformity to this Code as outlined below.<br /><br /><br /><br /><font size="+3"><b>Ethics and Standard of Conduct</b></font><br /><br />Suppliers, their agents and permitted subcontractors are expected to conduct business with integrity and mutual respect and to uphold the highest standards of ethics and behavior, including:<br /><br /><b>1) Business Integrity</b><br />Any and all forms of illegal or inappropriate activity, including, but not limited to, corruption, misrepresentation, extortion, embezzlement or bribery, are strictly prohibited and may result in termination of any or all supply agreements with SBM and possible legal action. Records prepared for SBM, including records of work time and expenses, shall be accurate, truthful and complete, and shall meet applicable standards and requirements.<br /><br /><b>2) Company Information</b><br />Safeguarding from disclosure SBM’s confidential and proprietary information concerning matters such as our business activities, strategies, plans, structure, technology, customers, financial situation and performance is critical to the company’s success, and such information cannot be disclosed or used, except in accordance with applicable regulations, contractual requirements and this Code. It is paramount that our business providers safeguard SBM’s information. Suppliers must:<br /><li>Understand any specific requirements for using SBM’s information and, when not sure, seek guidance from SBM.<br />Comply with applicable non-disclosure agreements and contractual confidentiality requirements regarding information belonging to or in the possession of SBM.<br />Immediately notify SBM of any request or demand by a third party for SBM information.<br />Never misuse or disclose confidential or proprietary information to unauthorized parties.<br />Use caution when discussing non-public information in public or any place where others may overhear.<br />Safeguard and appropriately handle SBM information and information regarding the SBM brand or logo.<br />Secure SBM’s written approval before using information about SBM or SBM’s name or brand identity publicly in any publicity, advertising or website.<br />Do not access, use, copy, manage, store or process company information outside the United States without the prior written approval of SBM.</li><br /><br /><b>3) Competitor Disparagement and Obtaining Information</b><br />SBM competes based on the strength of its products, services, reputation, and fair and accurate comparisons with its competitors. Suppliers should not make unfair, misleading, or inaccurate comparisons with the products and services of SBM’s competitors. SBM acquires competitive and other information only using proper means and without misrepresentation, and SBM’s suppliers, their agents and permitted subcontractors shall similarly do so.<br /><br /><b>4) Advertising and Marketing</b><br />If a SBM supplier is, with SBM’s prior written approval, engaged in any advertising, marketing or promotional activities that reference or implicate SBM, its name, logo or services in any manner, such materials must comply with all laws, rules and regulations, and must be truthful and accurate. Materials must not be false, misleading or have a tendency to deceive, and all claims must be substantiated.
